What are the important factors in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?

Welcome to the Brazil_noshowappointments_2016 Dataset project! I'm Jaime Rado, and in this project you will find my insights with regards to a dataset collected in 2016 over 100k medical appointments in Brazil. It is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row:
- ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
- ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brazilian welfare program Bolsa Família.

In this dataset I'll try to go trough all the data analysis steps: Introduction, Data Wrangling, EDA and provide some Conclusions.
